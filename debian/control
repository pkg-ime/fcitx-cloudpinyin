Description: Free Chinese Input Toy of X - cloudpinyin module
 Fcitx is the Free Chinese Input Toy of X, which was initially designed
 for Chinese users, and used XIM protocol. Now it has already evolved
 into a highly modularized, feature rich input method framework for
 Unix-like platforms supporting a considerable amount of frontends,
 backends and modules.
 .
 It is an ideal choice for the vast majority. Many of its features make
 users of Unix-like platforms have a fully modern input experience for
 the first time. It has also greatly lower the threshold for developers,
 making the development of extended funtions much easier than ever before.
 .
 This package provides the cloudpinyin module, which supports to make
 use of Pinyin APIs on the Internet and display the first result as the
 second input candidate.
 .
 Please be aware by installing and enabling this module, Fcitx will send
 your input data to the Internet to retrive result candidates.
